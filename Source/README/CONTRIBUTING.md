# Contributing to Vlyx Hub ⚡

First of all, thank you for using Vlyx Hub! While the source code is open for everyone to inspect and audit, this project follows a specific vision and restrictive license.

## 🌈 How Can You Help?

Because Vlyx Hub is a standalone project with a fixed architectural and visual design, we do not allow modifications or derivative versions of the software. However, your input is still very valuable!

### 🐞 Reporting Bugs
* If you find a technical error or a security vulnerability, please open an **Issue**.
* Describe the bug clearly and include steps to reproduce it.
* Mention your environment (PHP version, Browser).

### 💡 Feedback
* Feel free to share your experience using the software in the **Discussions** or **Issues** tab. While we don't accept feature requests that change the core vision, we love to hear how Vlyx Hub fits into your workflow.

## 🚫 What is NOT allowed?

To maintain the integrity of the project, the following actions are strictly prohibited under our license:

* **Pull Requests for Features**: We do not accept code contributions that add new features, change the UI, or modify the core logic.
* **Forks for Development**: You may not create a "better" or "improved" version of Vlyx Hub and redistribute it.
* **Redistribution of Modified Code**: Any version of Vlyx Hub you share must be the original, unmodified source code linking back to this repository.

## 🛠️ Development Setup
Vlyx is designed to be plug-and-play. The system will automatically generate the required JSON files and directories (`users/`, `users.json`, etc.) upon the first launch. No manual setup or code changes are required to get started.
