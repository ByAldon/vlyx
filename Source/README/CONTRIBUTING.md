## ❌ What we do NOT accept:
* **Feature Requests**: We do not add new features based on external requests.
* **Pull Requests**: Code changes or UI modifications will be closed without review.
* **Modified Forks**: You may fork the repo for hosting purposes, but you may not publish a modified version of Vlyx.
